## Requirements - Tea making selection

Produce a web application that has a team with a list of members. Each member of the team must have a skill level of either junior, intermediate or senior. The application must allow the user to randomly select the next team member to make the tea during a working day. The tea making selection algorithm must use these rules.

* A junior must be 3 times more likely to make the tea than a senior
* A intermediate must be 2 times more likely to make the tea than a senior
* A team member cannot make the tea 2 times in a row.

Please provide documentation on how to run the application.
